Add More Things
  http://docs.railsbridge.org/job-board/add_more_things

  Time to add more things!

  - The time where we tell you what to type in has finally ended.
  - You should do one or all of the things below!

  - Working independently or in pairs is super fun at this point.

  - Add a show page for each listing and move the Edit and Delete links to there.
  - Add validations â€”
    postings without titles or descriptions shouldn't be allowed, right?
  - Add other useful fields to jobs
  - Display jobs index in a table; make sortable with data_tables
  - Add tags (time for a has_many, folks!!!)
  - Make it look better
  - Add a user model and auth with Devise
  - Test it! Write a controller spec.
